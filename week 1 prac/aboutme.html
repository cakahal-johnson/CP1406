    <h3>My First memory of using the web</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ah, the nostalgia of the early days on the web! My first memory of using the web takes me back to the late '90s, a time when the internet was still a novel and mysterious realm. I vividly recall sitting in front of a chunky computer with a dial-up connection, the unmistakable sound of the modem screeching as it established a connection. The browser of choice back then was Netscape Navigator, and the concept of 'surfing the web' felt like embarking on a thrilling adventure.</li>

        <li>I navigated to a search engine, likely AltaVista or Yahoo at the time, and entered my very first search query. The excitement of watching the results unfold on the screen was unmatched. It was during this exploration that I stumbled upon a website filled with animated GIFs, vibrant backgrounds, and scrolling marqueesâ€”elements that defined the aesthetic of the early web.</li>

        <li>The experience left a lasting impression, igniting my curiosity about the possibilities of this virtual world. Little did I know that this initial encounter with the web would spark a lifelong interest in technology and eventually lead me to become a web developer. Reflecting on that moment, it's incredible to see how far the web has evolved, and I can't help but appreciate the journey from those humble beginnings to the sophisticated digital landscape we navigate today.</li>
